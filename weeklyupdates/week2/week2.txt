🎯 WEEK 2 GOAL

By end of this week:

YoctoLens should:

Detect last failing task

Extract recipe name

Extract task name

Extract error block

Print structured output

Still deterministic.
No AI yet.



By end of week we improve:

Clean recipe name (remove .bb)

Extract error snippet

Handle no-failure case cleanly

Add 3 sample logs in dataset/


Done week 2:

YoctoLens v0.5 can:
Parse full bitbake logs
Handle -k multi-error builds
Normalize recipe names
Classify common Yocto failures
Output structured CI JSON
